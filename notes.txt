## test_splay
* test splay insert/remove
* add weighted reinforement
* use weights to disregard
* test out garbage collection


## test_manual
* work on creating new sequences (beyond just pairs)
* test out garbage collection based on weight
* read in a lot of text (alice_1.txt) and see what patterns come out



## Set Probability
A set containing {a,b} is only worth keeping if a and b can be replaced with each other. that would mean that sequences: XaY and XbY would appear more likely than expected.  

C(X[ab]Y) = C(XaY) + C(XbY) 

C(Xa) + C(aY) and C(Xb) + C(bY)

C(Xa) would be C(a) as well as C(aY)

C(XaY) = C(Xa^Y) = C(X^aY)  <--- these two 3-sequences should be merged with this process

IDEA:

* Both sets and sequences are "unlikely" pairings of symbols
* Sets follow baysian statistics: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
* Sequences would not
